title: Data
---

This tutorial uses **simulated genotype and phenotype data** based on the **1000 Genomes Project Human Omni 2.5 array**.  
The dataset represents a subset of **~2,500 samples** and approximately **2 million SNPs**, focusing on **chromosome 20**. The data are designed to illustrate GWAS, imputation, and polygenic score (PGS) analysis workflows using realistic, but simulated, inputs derived from real genotype array structures.

### Chip Array Data

* **Filename:** `gwas.array.hapmap.chr20.vcf.gz` 
[Download](https://genepi.i-med.ac.at/downloads/imputation/gwas.array.hapmap.chr20.vcf.gz)
* **Description:** Simulated genotype array data for chromosome 20.
* **Format:** VCF (Variant Call Format), compressed with gzip.
* **Content:**
  * Biallelic SNPs representative of common variants from the HapMap panel.
  * Genotypes coded in standard VCF format (0/0, 0/1, 1/1).
* **Use:** Serves as the *input array dataset* for GWAS analysis prior to imputation.

### Imputed Data

* **Filename:** `gwas.imputed.chr20.dose.vcf.gz` [Download](https://genepi.i-med.ac.at/downloads/imputation/gwas.imputed.chr20.dose.vcf.gz)
* **Description:** Imputed genotype data for chromosome 20.
* **Format:** VCF with dosage values (0–2) for each SNP, compressed with gzip.
* **Content:**
  * Dense SNP coverage after imputation from the array data.
  * Dosage fields represent expected allele counts derived from imputation probabilities.
* **Use:** Used for downstream association tests and polygenic score calculations.

### Phenotype Data

* **Filename:** `phenotypes.txt` [Download](https://genepi.i-med.ac.at/downloads/imputation/phenotypes.txt)
* **Description:** Simulated phenotype file containing four traits.
* **Format:** Plain text (tab-delimited).
* **Columns:**
  * `sample_id` — individual sample identifiers
  * `pheno_1`, `pheno_2`, `pheno_3`, `pheno_4` — four simulated phenotypes
* **Use:** Provides phenotype data for GWAS and PGS evaluation.

| Phenotype   | Type                        | Highly Genetic? |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| **pheno_1** | Binary (e.g., case/control) | ✅ Yes           |
| **pheno_2** | Continuous (e.g., height)   | ✅ Yes           |
| **pheno_3** | Binary or categorical       | ❌ No            |
| **pheno_4** | Continuous                  | ❌ No            |

### Polygenic Scores

* **Filename:** `scores.txt` 
[Download](https://genepi.i-med.ac.at/downloads/imputation/scores.txt)
* **Description:** Simulated polygenic scores (PGS) corresponding to the four phenotypes.
* **Format:** Comma-delimited.
* **Columns:**
  * `sample` — individual identifiers matching the genotype data
  * `score_1`, `score_2`, `score_3`, `score_4` — simulated PGS values
* **Use:** Demonstrates PGS evaluation and performance comparison across phenotypes.

### Covariates (Principal Components)

* **Filename:** `covariates.txt` 
[Download](https://genepi.i-med.ac.at/downloads/imputation/covariates.txt)
* **Description:** Covariate file containing the first 10 genetic principal components (PCs) for each individual.
* **Format:** Tab-delimited, compressed with gzip.
* **Columns:**
  * `sample` — individual identifiers matching the genotype data
  * `PC1`–`PC10` — first ten principal components representing population structure
* **Use:** Used as covariates in association analyses to correct for population stratification.
