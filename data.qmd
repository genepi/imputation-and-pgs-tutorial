# Data

This tutorial uses **simulated genotype and phenotype data** based on the **1000 Genomes Project Human Omni 2.5 array**.  
The dataset represents a subset of **~2,500 samples** and approximately **2 million SNPs**, focusing on **chromosome 20**.

## Overview

The data are designed to illustrate GWAS, imputation, and polygenic score (PGS) analysis workflows using realistic, but simulated, inputs derived from real genotype array structures.

### File Descriptions

#### `gwas.array.hapmap.chr20.vcf.gz`
- **Description:** Simulated genotype array data for chromosome 20.  
- **Format:** VCF (Variant Call Format), compressed with gzip.  
- **Content:**  
  - Biallelic SNPs representative of common variants from the HapMap panel.  
  - Genotypes coded in standard VCF format (0/0, 0/1, 1/1).  
- **Use:** Serves as the *input array dataset* for GWAS analysis prior to imputation.

#### `gwas.imputed.chr20.dose.vcf.gz`
- **Description:** Imputed genotype data for chromosome 20.  
- **Format:** VCF with dosage values (0–2) for each SNP, compressed with gzip.  
- **Content:**  
  - Dense SNP coverage after imputation from the array data.  
  - Dosage fields represent expected allele counts derived from imputation probabilities.  
- **Use:** Used for downstream association tests and polygenic score calculations.

#### `phenotypes.txt`
- **Description:** Simulated phenotype file containing four traits.  
- **Format:** Plain text (tab-delimited).  
- **Columns:**  
  - `sample_id` — individual sample identifiers  
  - `pheno_1`, `pheno_2`, `pheno_3`, `pheno_4` — four simulated phenotypes  
- **Use:** Provides phenotype data for GWAS and PGS evaluation.

| Phenotype   | Type                        | Highly Genetic? |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| **pheno_1** | Binary (e.g., case/control) | ✅ Yes           |
| **pheno_2** | Continuous (e.g., height)   | ✅ Yes           |
| **pheno_3** | Binary or categorical       | ❌ No            |
| **pheno_4** | Continuous                  | ❌ No            |

#### `scores.txt.gz`
- **Description:** Simulated polygenic scores (PGS) corresponding to the four phenotypes.  
- **Format:** Tab-delimited, compressed with gzip.  
- **Columns:**  
  - `sample_id` — individual identifiers matching the genotype data  
  - `PGS_pheno_1`, `PGS_pheno_2`, `PGS_pheno_3`, `PGS_pheno_4` — simulated PGS values  
- **Use:** Demonstrates PGS evaluation and performance comparison across phenotypes.
