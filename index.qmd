This tutorial provides a practical introduction to key steps in modern genetic data analysis, including **genotype imputation**, **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**, and **polygenic risk score (PGS)** calculation.

Using the **Michigan Imputation Server (MIS)** as the imputation platform, the chapter demonstrates how to process and analyze genetic data in a reproducible workflow — from imputed genotypes to interpretable genetic associations.

You will learn how to:

* Perform and evaluate genotype imputation using the **Michigan Imputation Server**
* Conduct a **GWAS** to identify variants associated with phenotypes
* Calculate and visualize **polygenic risk scores (PRS)** for different trait types

The tutorial concludes with examples of four phenotypes, illustrating how PRS performance varies between binary and continuous traits — ranging from clear genetic signals to weak or absent associations.

This chapter aims to build a solid understanding of the concepts, tools, and interpretation steps that underpin large-scale human genetic studies.
